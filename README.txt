This project is a fork of the original: http://bnotes.sourceforge.net/

Building the project:
=====================
* For building the .NET-based subproject (BinaryNotes.NET), open the solution file
  (BinaryNotes.NET/BinaryNotes.sln) in MS Visual Studio and build the solution there
* For building the Java-based subprojects (BNCompiler and JavaLibrary), use Maven,
  i.e. run "mvn install" in the project root folder.
